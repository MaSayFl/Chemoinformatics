# Chemoinformatics
## Chemo_1
1. Basics, Database managment
There is a file with the name 'chem_id_pubmed.txt' in the folder with PubChem CIDs. Please, find a way to automatically download SMILES, Fingerprint2D, and MolecularFormula for these molecules. It must be a py-script written according to PEP-8 with comments. So, it takes as an input argument file-name and returns CSV-file with columns CID, SMILES, Fingerprint2D, and MolecularFormula.

2. Basics, format convertation
Make SDF-file from the output file from the previous assignment.

3. Basics, familiarize with RDKit library
The following assignments must be done in a jupyter notebook

4. Depict your molecules
Calculate similarity of molecules using MACCS Keys, Morgan Fingerprints, and RDKit fingerprint. Plot distribution of similarity values.
